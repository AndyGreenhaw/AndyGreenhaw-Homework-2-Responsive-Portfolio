## Summary

I tried to keep my portfolio website as clean and simple as possible because I plan on making it very content heavy. I organized the pages into Home, Portfolio, and Contact. The Home page contains the "About" section, although I plan to replace this later with something more interesting and give "About" its own page. The Portfolio features my demo reel, along with three sections of work broken into Animation, Video Editing, and Writing work - with more to come. And the contact page enables users to provide me their name, email, and a message. The bottom of the page displays links to my social media with icons.

## Table of Contents (Optional)
* Home Page
* Porfolio Page
* Contact Page

## Installation

To view the website, go to this URL: https://andygreenhaw.github.io/Homework-1---CSS-Git-Code-Refactor/.

## Usage 

The Home page features my headline "Andy Greenhaw" (which I'm optimizing for to make this my top content) and a short, rough summary about me I plan to update. Every page features a Navigation bar for users to click between Home, Porftolio, and Contact, and my social media links are featured at the foot of every page.

The Portfolio page features my demo reel, which you can click to play, and my work below the video if the user scrolls down. I've broken each section into my skill categories, which I plan to expand as I learn more about web design.

The Contact page prompts users to contact me if they could use my capabilities, and asks the user to provide their name, email, and a short message about their needs.
